# Pumpkin-Category-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Model-using-Logistic-Regression

Tools used: Python, Jupyter Notebooks

Libraries Used: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaeborn, Sci-Kit Learn, Logistic Regression

Flow:

---> Loading Data -> Data Analysis -> Data Cleaning -> Ordinal Encoding -> OneHot Encoding -> Column Transform -> Label Encoding -> Final Data to train machine learning model

---> Building Machine Learning Model using Sci-Kit Learn -> Logistic Regression -> Model Training -> Model Predictions -> Check of Model Accuracy using Metrics and Confusion Matrix -> ROC Curve to check model performance -> Final Machine learning Model
